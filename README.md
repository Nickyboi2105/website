## My Personal Website ECS Project
Welcome to my personal website project repository! This project showcases my family, work, aspirations, and personal interests through a dynamic digital portfolio.

## How It's Made
This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've chosen a selection of fonts and navigation styles that reflect my preference for elegance and sophistication. As green is my favorite color, I've incorporated it as the base/background color for the site, lending it a visually pleasing aesthetic.

## Optimizations/Features
- Carousel: Implemented a carousel near the footer to display dynamic content.
- Email Button: Added a convenient email button for direct communication.
- Fading Animation: Utilized CSS and JavaScript to create a captivating fading animation on the homepage.
## Lessons Learned
Throughout the development process, I've encountered valuable lessons:

- GitHub Uploads: Learned to pace file uploads to GitHub to prevent computer freezing.
- Challenges: Faced difficulties in implementing a video element and devising a multi-page navigation system, which provided opportunities for growth and problem-solving.

My Personal Website ECS Project
This is my personal proftolio which is about my family, work, aspirations & myself.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I like class things that look fabolous so I chose this seleciton of font and navigation. My favorite color is green so I made it the base/background color of my site.

Optimizations/Features:
I implemented a carousel near the footer and a button to email my personal mail. In addition I incorporated a fading animation via CSS/JS for my home page

Lessons Learned:
Something I learned was to not push all of my files into Github right away as it froze my computer for a solid 10 minutes
I faced two main challenges which were implementing a video and a multi-page navigation system
